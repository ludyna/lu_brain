# Lu_Brain Coding Style 

It took me twenty years of experience in programming and a few years of trials and errors to develop the style I used in this project. It probably will still be improved here and there, but it is primarily stable now. I know programming style is personal preference, but I love it and hope you will too! For obvious reasons, all contributions to this project must be made in the same coding style <3.

Below I will try to explain how I do it and why.

BONUS: 

By learning this style, you will also:

- Learn how to program large applications in C
- Learn how to program OOP in C
- Develop taste to good programming style


WORK IN PROGRESS
