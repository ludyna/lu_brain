# Lu_Brain Coding Style 

It took twenty years of experience in programming and a few years of trials and errors to develop the style I used in this project. It probably will still be improved here and there, but it is primarily stable now. I know programming style is a personal preference, but I love it and hope you will too! For obvious reasons, all contributions to this project should be in the same coding style ‚ù§.

Below I will try to explain how I do it and why.

BONUS: 

By learning this style, you will also:

- Learn how to program large applications in C.
- Learn how to program OOP in C.
- Develop a taste for a good programming style.
- Become one major step closer to becoming a master of C and a master of programming in general.

## Why C?



## WORK IN PROGRESS

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CODEBASE IS NOT IN A PERFECT STATE RIGHT NOW WHILE WORK IS IN PROGRESS.
When we finish the main functionality, we will polish the codebase and coding style and remove inconsistencies.
