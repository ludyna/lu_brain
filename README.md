## About

Oleh Ihorovych Novosad is the original author of this library.
Oleh believes our brain or consciousness does not use gradient descent or genetic algorithms because it would be a big waste of computational and energy resources. Therefore, Oleh based Lu_Brain essential algorithms on his theory of information and pattern recognition.

___The library is free to use by everyone with good intentions___ and is contributors expression of goodwill and good intention towards humanity.

## Goals

1. The fastest pattern recognition and manipulation in the World
2. Pattern database with complete data transparency and ease of access
3. Easy to use, well designed and architected, fast and bug-free, enjoyable to contribute software
