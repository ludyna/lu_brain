# Lu_Brain

Lu_Brain is an open-source C library for custom AI algorithms that is a pattern manipulation engine and pattern database simultaneously. 

___More info soon. This project is a work in progress at this moment.___

## About

Lu_Brain is an artificial neural network that is not a gradient descent algorithm. But, of course, human brains do not use gradient descent algorithms; that would be a big waste of computational and energy resources. 

Author (Oleh Ihorovych Novosad) created/invented Lu_Brain essential algorithms based on his information theory of pattern recognition.

The library is free to use by everyone with good intentions and is the author's expression of goodwill and good intention towards humanity.

## Goal

1. The fastest pattern recognition and manipulation in the World
2. Pattern database with complete data transparency and easy access
3. Easy to use, well designed and architected, fast and bug-free, enjoyable to contribute software
