# Lu_Brain

Lu_Brain is an artificial neural network that is not a gradient descent algorithm. But, of course, human brains do not use gradient descent algorithms, too; that would be a big waste of computational and energy resources.


___More info soon. This project is a work in progress at this moment.___

## About

I believe human brains are optimal or close to optimal. So to create natural intelligence, we have to create something similar (in an algorithmic sense) to what our brains do.

I see two main approaches to achieve it:

1. Try to understand brain algorithms by observing them. Unfortunately, this approach is tough to deduct complicated algorithms. It's like trying to understand what computer programs do by only observing hardware (CPU, motherboard, RAM, etc.). This approach is good at understanding basics, but it is hard to deduct algorithms from it.

2. Try to use logic, imagination, creativity, intuition, math, and what we already know about our brains to recreate our brain algorithms.

In this project, I use the second approach.

What is different about this project compared to purely mathematical models based on gradient descent algorithms is that the resulting library will contain an algorithm(s) close to what the human brain does. 

## Why

1. To better understand how human brain algorithms work, which has application in medicine and health-oriented devices and making humans more intelligent.
2. To open possibilities for new tech like neural databases, artificial telepathy, clever robotic, and virtual servants.
3. Move AI's ease of use to the next level.
4. Bring tech that will help humanity to survive the next extinction event.

FOR THE GLORY OF HUMANITY AND THE LARGER CONSCIOUSNESS SYSTEM! :)
