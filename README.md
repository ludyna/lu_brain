# Lu_Brain

Lu_Brain is a pattern manipulation engine and pattern database open-source C library.

___More info soon. This project is a work in progress at this moment.___

## About

Lu_Brain does NOT use gradient descent algorithms.
Lu_Brain does NOT use genetic algorithms.

The author (Oleh Ihorovych Novosad) believes our brain or consciousness does not use them too. It would be a big waste of computational and energy resources.
 
The author created/invented Lu_Brain essential algorithms based on his information theory of pattern recognition.

The library is free to use by everyone with good intentions and is the author's expression of goodwill and good intention towards humanity.

## Goals

1. The fastest pattern recognition and manipulation in the World
2. Pattern database with complete data transparency and ease of access
3. Easy to use, well designed and architected, fast and bug-free, enjoyable to contribute software
