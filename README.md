# Lu_Brain 

Lu_Brain is a _pattern database_ open-source C library.

⚠ ___More info soon. This project is a work in progress at this moment.___ ⚠

## Why Lu_Brain?

#### Dynamicity

Lu_Brain allows "learning on the fly" without retraining of artificial neural network (ANN). With Lu_Brain, it is natural to "forget" and "learn" new patterns dynamically. It also allows the creation of AI that learns while it functions. Imagine game AI that learns new tricks from players while they play.

#### Transparency and Control

When working with "classic" ANN, information is in weights, but it is hard to understand where. Lu_Brain gives you a complete understanding of where information is. You can ask Lu_Brain to forget specific patterns or replace them with new ones dynamically. You can see a complete path that led to a specific decision. It means that you have complete data transparency and control over how AI works. No more unexplainable magic (output). 

#### Speed

Learning speed does not depend on the number of already learned patterns, which means that dynamic learning speed is O(1). 
Pattern recognition speed is also O(1).


## Goals  

1. The fastest dynamic pattern learning and manipulation in the World
2. Pattern database with complete data transparency and ease of access
3. Easy to use, well designed and architected, fast and bug-free, enjoyable to contribute software

## FAQ

Q: **Why C?**

A: Lu_Brain is a low-level library, and, in short, C is the best language for the job (not C++, Rust, Go, Python, etc.). Later we will create wrappers for higher-level languages.

## Legal

___The library is free to use by everyone with good intentions (MIT_LICENSE).___

The library is our expression of goodwill and good intention towards humanity.
