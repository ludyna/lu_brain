# Lu_Brain 

Lu_Brain is a next-generation [AI2 technology](https://ai2tech.org) _pattern database_ open-source C library.

⚠ ___More info soon. This project is a work in progress at this moment.___ ⚠

## Why Lu_Brain?

Lu_Brain is an AI2 technology.

#### Dynamicity

Lu_Brain allows learning "on the fly" without artificial neural networks (ANN) retraining. With Lu_Brain, it is natural to "forget" and "learn" new patterns dynamically. It also allows the creation of AI that learns while it functions. For example, imagine game AI that learns new tricks from players during the game.

#### Transparency and Control

When working with "classic" ANN, information is in "weights," but it is hard to understand where exactly. Lu_Brain gives you a complete understanding of where information is. You can ask Lu_Brain to forget specific patterns or replace them with new ones dynamically. You can see a complete path that led to a specific decision. It means that you have complete data transparency and control over how AI works. No more unexplainable magic output.

#### Speed

Learning speed does not depend on the number of already learned patterns (no gradient descent). 

Pattern matching speed depends on the quality of expected results (the mathematically most correct answer will require more calculations).  

The mathematically most correct answer for provided data is always achievable. There are no "local minimum" or "saddle points" problems in the Lu_Brain algorithm.

## Goals

1. The fastest dynamic pattern learning and manipulation in the World
2. Pattern database with complete data transparency and ease of access
3. Easy to use, well designed and architected, fast and bug-free, enjoyable to contribute software

## FAQ

Q: **Why C?**

A: Lu_Brain is a low-level library, and, in short, C is the best language for the job (not C++, Rust, Go, Python, etc.). Later we will create wrappers for higher-level languages.

## Legal

___The library is free to use by everyone with good intentions (MIT_LICENSE).___

The library is our expression of goodwill and good intention towards humanity.
